# Basic Probability Concepts
* **Probability(확률)** the chance that an uncertain event will occur (always between 0 and 1)     
* **Impossible Event** – an event that has no chance of occurring (probability = 0)    
* **Certain Event** – an event that is sure to occur (probability = 1)     



**[Assessing Probability]**     
There are **three approaches** to assessing the probability of an uncertain event:       
**1)** **a priori**      
based on prior knowledge of the process         


**2) empirical probability**

3) subjective probability
=
X
T =
number of ways in which the event occurs
total number of possible outcomes
based on a combination of an individual’s past experience, 
personal opinion, and analysis of a particular situation
