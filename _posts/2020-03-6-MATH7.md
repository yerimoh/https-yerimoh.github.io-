이 단원은 힘을주며 배우지  않아도 된다.

# Continuous Probability Distributions
**[continuous variable]**        
a variable that can assume any value on a continuum (can assume an uncountable number of values)       
• thickness of an item
• time required to complete a task
• temperature of a solution
• height, in inches

These can potentially take on any value depending only on the ability to precisely and accurately measure

# The Normal Distribution
정규 분포      
* **‘Bell Shaped’**: 가운데가 볼록해야한다(필수조건)      
* **Symmetrical**: 대칭이여야 한다(필수조건)            
* Mean, Median and Mode are Equal

* **Location** is determined by the **mean, μ**      
* **Spread** is determined by the **standard deviation, σ**         
* The random variable has an infinite theoretical **range**: + ∞ to - ∞

* e = the mathematical constant approximated by 2.71828   
* π = the mathematical constant approximated by 3.14159    
* μ = the population mean   
* σ = the population standard deviation    
* X = any value of the continuous variable

* A and B have the same mean but different standard deviations.   
* B and C have different means and different standard deviations.
