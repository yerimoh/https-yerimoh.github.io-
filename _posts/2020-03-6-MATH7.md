# Continuous Probability Distributions
**[continuous variable]**        
a variable that can assume any value on a continuum (can assume an uncountable number of values)         
• thickness of an item    
• time required to complete a task   
• temperature of a solution    
• height, in inches   

These can potentially take on any value depending only on the ability to precisely and accurately measure

# The Standardized Normal
표준정규분포        
= **평균이 0**이고 **분산이 1**인 정규분포     

* Any normal distribution (with any mean and standard deviation combination) can be transformed into the standardized normaldistribution (Z)       
➡️ 모든 정규분포(평균 및 표준편차 조합 포함)는 표준화된 정규분포(Z)로 변환 가능     
* To compute normal probabilities need to transform X units into Z units      
➡️ 정규 확률을 계산하려면 X 단위를 Z 단위로 변환 필요        
* The standardized normal distribution (Z) has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

**[formula of Translation]**     
Translate from X to the standardized normal (the “Z” distribution) by subtracting the mean of X and dividing by its standard deviation

The Z distribution always has,     
* mean = 0     
* standard deviation = 1

**ex 1)**     
If X is distributed normally with mean of $100 and standard deviation of $50, the Z value for X = $200 is,

* This says that X = $200 is two standard deviations (2 increments of $50 units) above the mean of $100

**[Distribution]**         
• Also known as the “Z” distribution      
• **Mean is 0**      
• **Standard Deviation is 1**

* Values above the mean have positive Z-values.   
* Values below the mean have negative Z-value     


❓ **Comparing X and Z units**      
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/136920060-72afbcd6-b834-4d7f-85a6-7fc9d831132f.png)   
Note that the shape of,       
* the **distribution** is the **same**        
* only the **scale** has **changed**                

We can express the problem in the original units (X in dollars) or in standardized units (Z)

# Finding Normal Probabilities

Probability is measured by the area under the curve     
이제 정규분포에서 아래와 같이 연속적인 확률의 합을 구하는 방법을 볼 것이다.

**[Probability as Area Under the Curve]**     
The total area under the curve is 1.0, and the curve is symmetric, so half is above the mean, half is below

# 문제


**[Table 6-1] 
You were told that the amount of time lapsed between consecutive trades on the New York Stock Exchange followed a normal distribution with a mean of 15 seconds. You were also told that the probability that the time lapsed between two consecutive trades to fall between 16 to 17 seconds was 13%. The probability that the time lapsed between two consecutive trades would fall below 13 seconds was 7%.**


**1. Referring to Table 6-1, what is the probability that the time lapsed between two consecutive trades will be between 14 and 15 seconds?**

**4. If a particular batch of data is approximately normally distributed, we would find that approximately**      
a) 2 of every 3 observations would fall between 1 standard deviation around the mean.     
b) 4 of every 5 observations would fall between 1.28 standard deviations around the mean.     
c) 19 of every 20 observations would fall between 2 standard deviations around the mean.      
d) All the above.

이렇다는 이야기다.
