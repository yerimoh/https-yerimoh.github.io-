# Key Takeaways
* DLI ambassadors in Korea Status (2022)- Korea DLI Ambassadors are one of the most actively growing community - 4th largest (USA > China > India > Korea)     
* DLI Ambassador can be the first building block on NVIDIA collaboration in higher education & research field.     
* NVIDIA Developer Program and NVIDIA technology is the foundation of the DLI program.    
* NVIDIA is open for further collaboration on research & education partner program

* SNU - Adopt DLI on undergraduate university class curriculum    
* Halla - Run the largest university autonomous driving competition in Korea. Platform is built on jetson (200 EA in 2022)    

# Roundtable Session   
* [Seungyun] Suggest add addtional advanced test material on assessment who finish final assessment early. (We can implement instructor assessment)    
* [Seungyun] Suggest Healthcare Instructor Workshop Course and course development opportunity     
* [Kukwon] We would like to expand this competition & education program on Jetson but its supply shortage. Can we get support on this?    
* [Kukwon] Suggest to issue award by NVIDIA on autonomous driving competition      
* [Hongsook] CIP program - When applying for the CIP program in Korea, we are only allowed to get Korean course material but then we need to have a interview with English interviewer so that we would like to get access and review the English course. Can you help to provide Korean / English course as well?    
* [Hongsook] Sometimes there is a minor translation error in the course -> We need a bug/issue reporting place where we can gather the feedback on the course. Korean DLI Ambassadors will help to review the course together.    
* [Solee] I often get the request for attendees to share English material while on workshop. Would it be possible to share English course material with attendees?   
* [Sungsook] Jetson DLI docker seems to be not working well during the classroom. Can we make a checklist for environment set up? We can make a wiki docs together   
* [Myungwan] DLI jupyter notebook is not sync with latest SDK info. Can we have better alignment from development wise?   
* [Will] Share the idea to professional certification   


Worth it for Korea region? Yes. Will be helpful    
Can we go for English program in the Korea regioin? or wait for Korean course to come - Go with English program first.    


Interviewer is not considered in this program as we want to lower the fee.    
Hope that we can have pre-requisite or pre-workshop for the applicants    
Set up levels on the program? Yes. preferrable   
Go with the highest level and split the levels sounds reasonable

# 후기
엠베서더로 활동하면서 그동안 다른 엠베더서 님들, 엔비디아 개발자 분들이랑 온라인으로 밖에 소통할 기회가 없어서 아쉬웠는데, 이번 밋업을 통해서 오프라인으로 만나뵐 수 있어 정말 좋았다.

또한 밋업을 통해서 개발자님들과 직접 tech talk를 하니 많은 것들을 알아갈 수 있어 저에겐 정말 소중한 시간이었다. 앞으로도 이런 행사가 자주 개최되었으면 좋겠다 :)
