# Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: Two-Sample Tests
즉, 가설검증이다.     
test라는 위딩이 들어갔다는 것은 이 추정의 결과로 인한 **의사결정**까지 한다는 것이다.     

Two-Sample Tests: 데이터 세트가 두개이다.      
* One-Sample Tests: 우리나라 사람의 아이큐가 100 이상이다 -> 우리나라 사람의 아이큐라는 하나의 데이터 세트가 필요하다     
* Two-Sample Tests: 우리나라와 일본의 아이큐를 비교해보면 우리나라가 더 높다 -> 우리나라 아이쿠 데이터 세트와 일본의 아이큐 데이터세트가 필요하다. 즉, 비교, 변화 검증에 많이 쓰인다.

* Comparing the mean of Two **Independent Populations**      
* Comparing the mean of Two **Related Populations**   
* Comparing the **Proportions** of Two **Independent** Populations

## 각각 구하는 식
이제 여기에 나온 식들을 예를 들어 하나씩 사용해볼 것이다!   
(지금은 이렇다~ 정도만 알아두자)      
왜 이런식이 유도되었는지 보단 어떤 문제라서 어떤 식을 써야하는 지가 중요하다     
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145272669-55770894-9361-4371-9623-ffffd8a8dd14.png)

# Independent Sample
즉 두개의 데이터가 독립적인 샘플이란 것이다.

예를 들어 TV가격에 대한 샘플이라면 아래와 같은 느낌이다

# Example: Pooled-Variance t-test
그럼 이제 문제로 예를 들어보자    
**σ(퍼짐의 정도)를 알 때 ➡️ Z-test** 의 경우는 너무 쉬워서 밑의 연습문제에서 다뤄보겠다!     
지금은 **σ(퍼짐의 정도)를 모를 때 ➡️ t-test**의 문제를 보며 어떻게 푸는지 살펴보자      

전반적인 과정은 전의 포스팅인         
* [One-Sample Tests_Hypothesis & Z-Test](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH10/)    
* 📌 [One-Sample Tests_𝜎 Unknown (t test)](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH11/)    
* [One-Sample Tests_one tail test](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH12/)       
* [One-Sample Tests_Hypothesis Tests for Proportions](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH13/)   

을 참고하고 떠올리면 좋을 것 같다(전반적인 과정은 비슷하다)

## PROBLEM
You are a financial analyst for a brokerage firm. Is there a difference in dividend yield between stocks listed on the NYSE & NASDAQ? You collect the following data: NYSE NASDA
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145314578-06c66733-740e-4f58-9317-6543b0c61de4.png)
Assuming both populations are approximately normal with equal variances, is there a difference in mean yield (a = 0.05)


  


----
----

## SOLVE 1   



**1) Check: 데이터의 Independent VS Related**     
확인해보면 Number 즉, sample size가 다르다   
➡️ 📌 **related는 무조건 samlpe size가 같아야 한다**      
즉 이건 independent 하다  -> Pooled-Variance t-test 의 방법을 따라야 한다     

----


**2) Check: tail 확인**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145270068-ececfdef-892e-4253-9f20-dae81d1dcc74.png)

is there a difference in mean yield       
➡️ 문제의 최종 의도는 sample mean인 3.27과 2.53을 다르다고 볼 수 있을까? 이다     
➡️ [Two-tail test](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH11/)     

-----


**3) 정규성 확인**      
Assuming both populations are approximately normal가 있는 이유: sample size가 각각 21, 25로 모두 30을 넘지 않기 때문에 이러한 가정이 필요하다.     
➡️ 정규성 확보!   

---

**2) 조건 확인**   
* $$H_0$$: μ1- μ2 = 0 i.e. (μ1= μ2)       
* $$H_1$$: μ1- μ2 ≠ 0 i.e. (μ1≠ μ2)      
* a = 0.05    
* df = 21 + 25 - 2 = 44       


-----


**3) Find Rejection Region: Critical Values**      
a를 이용하여 t-table에서 구하기         
[더 알아보기](https://yerimoh.github.io/MATH11/#formula)      
Critical Values: t = 2.0154     
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145272031-2ebf5beb-43f6-4259-87f3-c0d5c2f1c4d5.png)

-----


**4) Test Statistic**    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145273095-985930b0-1427-44cd-827d-31e8261333c1.png)
이므로 이에 그냥 대입만 하면,    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145273557-f21528e2-d20b-4a08-a365-8d69ded6a941.png)

------


**3) Decision**    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76824611/145273642-5d70c675-c830-4cd7-8d43-833eae517bd0.png)
Reach a decision and interpret the result:          
➡️ **Reject $$H_0$$ at a = 0.05**         
* There is sufficient evidence of a difference in means.

**[TABLE B]**       
A real estate company is interested in testing whether, on average, families in Gotham have been living in their current homes for less time than families in Metropolis have. Assume that the two population variances are equal. A random sample of 100 families from Gotham and a random sample of 150 families in Metropolis yield the following data on length of residence in current homes.             
Gotham: $$X ̅ _{G}$$ = 35 months,   $$s_{G}^2$$ = 900

[TABLE H]       
A problem with a telephone line that prevents a customer from receiving or making calls is disconcerting to both the customer and the telephone company. The data on samples of 20 problems reported to two different offices of a telephone company and the time to clear these problems (in minutes) from the customers’ lines are collected. Below is the Excel output to see whether there is evidence of a difference in the mean waiting time between the two offices assuming that the population variances in the two offices are not equal.

**22. The production manager at a battery factory wants to determine whether there is any difference in the mean life expectancy of batteries manufactured on two different types of machines. A random sample of 25 batteries from machine A indicates a sample mean of 250 hours and a population standard deviation of 100 hours, and a similar sample of 25 from machine B indicates a sample mean of 242 hours and a population standard deviation of 75 hours. Using 0.05 Sig level, is there any evidence of a difference in the mean life of batteries produced by the two types of machines?**
