# Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: Two-Sample Tests
즉, 가설검증이다.     
test라는 위딩이 들어갔다는 것은 이 추정의 결과로 인한 **의사결정**까지 한다는 것이다.     

Two-Sample Tests: 데이터 세트가 두개이다.      
* One-Sample Tests: 우리나라 사람의 아이큐가 100 이상이다 -> 우리나라 사람의 아이큐라는 하나의 데이터 세트가 필요하다     
* Two-Sample Tests: 우리나라와 일본의 아이큐를 비교해보면 우리나라가 더 높다 -> 우리나라 아이쿠 데이터 세트와 일본의 아이큐 데이터세트가 필요하다. 즉, 비교, 변화 검증에 많이 쓰인다.

# Example: Z Test for Proportion  
Proportion은 무조건 z-table을 쓴다!

## PROBLEM
**A marketing company claims that it receives 8% responses from its mailing. To test this claim, a random sample of 500 were surveyed with 25 responses. Test at the a = 0.05 significance level.**


➡️  **it receives 8% responses**: 퍼센트가 나왔으므로 proprotion 문제라는 것을 알 수 있다.       




----

## SOLVE 1   
**1) Check: 정규성 확인**      
* nπ = (500)(.08) = 40     
* n(1-π) = (500)(.92) = 460      


**2) 조건 확인**   
* $$H_0$$: π = 0.08   
* $$H_1$$: π != 0.08   
* a = 0.05       
* n = 500, p = 0.05     


**3) Find Rejection Region: Critical Values**      
a를 이용하여 z-table에서 구하기

**3) Decision**    
Reach a decision and interpret the result:          
➡️ **Reject $$H_0$$ at a = 0.05**         
* There is sufficient evidence to reject the company’s claim of 8% response rate

➡️ **Reject H0 since p-value = 0.0136 < a = 0.**     
* There is sufficient evidence to reject the company’s claim of 8% response rate

# 문제
[TABLE 9-1]     
An appliance manufacturer claims to have developed a compact microwave oven that consumesan average of no more than 250 W. From previous studies, it is believed that power consumptionfor microwave ovens is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 15 W. A consumergroup has decided to try to discover if the claim appears true. They take a sample of 20 microwave ovens and find that they consume an average of 257.3 W.       


**1. Referring to Table 9-1, the parameter of interest is**    
a) the mean power consumption of the 20 microwave ovens.   
b) the mean power consumption of all such microwave ovens.

[TABLE 9-3]
How many Kleenex should the Kimberly Clark Corporation package of tissues contain? Researchers determined that 60 tissues is the average number of tissues used during a cold. Suppose a random sample of 100 Kleenex users yielded the following data on the number of tissues used during a cold: X = 52, s = 22.  


**9. Referring to Table 9-3, give the null and alternative hypotheses to determine if the number of tissues used during a cold is less than 60.**    
A. $$𝐻_0$$: 𝜇 ≤ 60 and $$𝐻_1$$: 𝜇 > 60.   
B. $$𝐻_0$$: 𝜇 ≥ 60 and $$𝐻_1$$: 𝜇 < 60.   
C. $$𝐻_0$$: x ̅  ≥  60 and $$𝐻_1$$: x ̅   <  60.   
D. $$𝐻_0$$: x ̅  =  52 and $$𝐻_1$$: x ̅  != 52.

[TABLE 9-5]
A major videocassette rental chain is considering opening a new store in an area that currently does not have any such stores. The chain will open if there is evidence that more than 5,000 of the 20,000 households in the area are equipped with videocassette recorders (VCRs). It conducts a telephone poll of 300 randomly selected households in the area and finds that 96 have VCRs. 14. Referring to Table 9-5, state the test of interest to the rental chain.      
A. $$𝐻_0$$: 𝜋 ≤ 0.32 versus $$𝐻_1$$: 𝜋 > 0.32    
B. $$𝐻_0$$: 𝜋 ≤ 0.25 versus $$𝐻_1$$: 𝜋 > 0.25
