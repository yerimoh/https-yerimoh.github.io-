measuresProperty: indicates the PROPERTY (e.g.,
ORR activity) that is measured.
conditionSampleFeatures: indicates the SAMPLE
or MATERIAL whose property is measured. In
the above example, the sample is the catalyst.
usesTechnique: relates to the TECHNIQUE (e.g.,
linear scan voltammetry) used in a measurement.
conditionInstrument: refers to the INSTRUMENT
used to make a measurement, e.g., RDE/rotating
disk electrode.
conditionProperty: a property that is a condition
in the experiment, e.g., scan rate (which in turn
has the propertyValue of 50 mv/s).
propertyValue: connects the mention of a PROPERTY and that of its corresponding VALUE. This
relation may also occur if a mention of a PROPERTY occurs independently of a measurement.
conditionEnvironment: identifies the MATERIALs (e.g., O2 and HClO4) and VALUEs (e.g.,
an operating temperature of 30Â°C) that provide
the environment of the measurement.
takenFrom: connects the MEASUREMENT with
the bibliographic reference CITE from which the
setup has been inspired or taken over.

Further Relations

hasForm: connects mention of MATERIAL and
the corresponding FORM annotation.
usedIn: connects MATERIAL and the DEVICE it
is used in. In Table 2, MOSFET stands for Metal
Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors.
usedAs: links a specific MATERIAL mention with
a more generic one such as catalyst, a material
class defined by its function.
dopedBy: indicates dopants (e.g., chlorine), i.e.,
impurities added to a main material (e.g., SiC).
usedTogether: connects two MATERIALs if they
are used together in an experiment, i.e., if the
materials are part of an assembly or a mixture.
