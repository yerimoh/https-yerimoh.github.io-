MAT: mentions of materials described by their
chemical formula (WO3) or its chemical name
(indium tin oxide).
FORM: mentions of the form or morphology of
the material, e.g., thin film, gas, liquid, cubic.
INSTRUMENT: mentions of devices used to perform a materials-science-related measurement,
e.g., Olympus BX52 microscope.
DEVICE: mentions of devices (target products)
whose construction or improvement is the aim

UNIT, e.g., ~5 x 3mm2
CITE: citations, e.g., Setman et al. or [13].
PROPERTY: expressions referring to properties
of materials or conditions in experiments, e.g.,
stress rate or electron conductivity.
TECHNIQUE: mentions of experimental techniques used in the characterization steps, e.g.,
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
SAMPLE: mention of the material or a component
made of materials studied in a measurement, either referred to by a particular name or its com
