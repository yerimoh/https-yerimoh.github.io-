provide promising information extraction tools, these models may yield suboptimal results when applied on
materials domain since they are not trained in materials science specific notations and jargons. Here, we present a materials-aware
language model, namely, MatSciBERT, trained on a large corpus of peer-reviewed materials science publications. We show that
MatSciBERT outperforms SciBERT, a language model trained on science corpus, and establish state-of-the-art results on three
downstream tasks, named entity recognition, relation classification, and abstract classification. We make the pre-trained weights of
MatSciBERT publicly accessible for accelerated materials discovery and information extraction from materials science texts.



# INTRODUCTION
Discovering materials and utilizing them for practical applications
is an extremely time-consuming process that may span decades1,2
.
To accelerate this process, we need to exploit and harness the
knowledge on materials that has been developed over the
centuries through rigorous scientific procedure in a cohesive
fashion3–8
. Textbooks, scientific publications, reports, handbooks,
websites, etc., serve as a large data repository that can be mined
for obtaining the already existing information9,10. However, it is a
challenging task to extract useful information from these texts
since most of the scientific data is semi- or un-structured in the
form of text, paragraphs with cross reference, image captions, and
tables10–12. Extracting such information manually is extremely
time- and resource-intensive and relies on the interpretation of a
domain expert.



Natural language processing (NLP), a sub-domain in artificial
intelligence, presents an alternate approach that can automate
information extraction from text. Earlier approaches in NLP relied
on non-neural methods based on n-grams such as Brown et al.
(1992)13, structural learning framework by Ando and Zhang
(2005)14, or structural correspondence learning by Blitzer et al.
(2006)15, but these are no longer state of the art. Neural pretrained embeddings like word2vec16,17 and GloVe18 are quite
popular, but they lack domain-specific knowledge and do not
produce contextual embeddings. Recent progress in NLP has led
to the development of a computational paradigm in which a large,
pre-trained language model (LM) is finetuned for domain-specific
tasks. Research has consistently shown that this pretrain-finetune
paradigm leads to the best overall task performance19–23.
Statistically, LMs are probability distributions for a sequence of
words such that for a given set of words, it assigns a probability to
each word24. Recently, due to the availability of large amounts of
text and high computing power, researchers have been able to
pre-train these large neural language models. For example,
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)25
is trained on BookCorpus26 and English Wikipedia, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP tasks like question
answering and entity recognition, to name a few.


Researchers have used NLP tools to automate database creation
for ML applications in the materials science domain. For instance,
ChemDataExtractor27, an NLP pipeline, has been used to create
databases of battery materials28, Curie and Néel temperatures of
magnetic materials29, and inorganic material synthesis routes30.
Similarly, NLP has been used to collect the composition and
dissolution rate of calcium aluminosilicate glassy materials31, and
zeolite synthesis routes to synthesize germanium containing
zeolites32, and to extract process and testing parameters of oxide
glasses, thereby enabling improved prediction of the Vickers
hardness11. Researchers have also made an automated NLP tool to
create databases using the information extracted from computational materials science research papers33. NLP has also been used
for other tasks such as topic modeling in glasses, that is, to group
the literature into different topics in an unsupervised fashion and
to find images based on specific queries such as elements present,
synthesis, or characterization techniques, and applications10


A comprehensive review by Olivetti et al. (2019) describes
several ways in which NLP can benefit the materials science
community34. Providing insights into chemical parsing tools like
OSCAR435 capable of identifying entities and chemicals from text,
Artificial Chemist36, which takes the input of precursor information
and generates synthetic routes to manufacture optoelectronic
semiconductors with targeted band gaps, robotic system for
making thin films to produce cleaner and sustainable energy
solutions37, and identification of more than 80 million materials
science domain-specific named entities, researches have
prompted the accelerated discovery of materials for different
applications through the combination of ML and NLP techniques.
Researchers have shown the domain adaptation capability of
word2vec and BERT in the field of biological sciences as
BioWordVec38 and BioBERT19, other domain-specific BERTs like
SciBERT21 trained on scientific and biomedical corpus39, clinicalBERT40 trained on 2 million clinical notes in MIMIC-III v1.
database41, mBERT42 for multilingual machine translations tasks,
PatentBERT23 for patent classification and FinBERT for financial
tasks22. This suggests that a materials-aware LM can significantly
accelerate the research in the field by further adapting to
downstream tasks9,34. Although there were no papers on
developing materials-aware language models prior to this work43,
in a recent preprint44, Walker et al. (2021) emphasize the impact of
domain-specific language models on named entity recognition
(NER) tasks in materials science.



In this work, we train materials science domain-specific BERT,
namely MatSciBERT. Figure 1 shows the graphical summary of the
methodology adopted in this work encompassing creating the
materials science corpus, training the MatSciBERT, and evaluating
different downstream tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art results on
domain-specific tasks as listed below.

a. NER on SOFC, SOFC Slot dataset by Friedrich et al. (2020)45
and Matscholar dataset by Weston et al. (2019)9

b. Glass vs. Non-Glass classification of paper abstracts10

c. Relation Classification on MSPT corpus46


The present work, thus, bridges the gap in the availability of a
materials domain language model, allowing researchers to
automate information extraction, knowledge graph completion,
and other downstream tasks and hence accelerate the discovery
of materials. We have hosted the MatSciBERT pre-trained weights
at https://huggingface.co/m3rg-iitd/matscibert and codes for pretraining and finetuning on downstream tasks at https://github.
com/M3RG-IITD/MatSciBERT. Also, the codes with finetuned
models for the downstream tasks are available at https://doi.org/
