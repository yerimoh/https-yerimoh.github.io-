# Abstract
Style control, content preservation, and fluency
determine the quality of text style transfer models. To train on a nonparallel corpus, several
existing approaches aim to deceive the style discriminator with an adversarial loss. However,
adversarial training significantly degrades fluency compared to the other two metrics. In
this work, we explain this phenomenon using energy-based interpretation, and leverage
a pretrained language model to improve fluency. Specifically, we propose a novel approach which applies the pretrained language
model to the text style transfer framework by
restructuring the discriminator and the model
itself, allowing the generator and the discriminator to also take advantage of the power of
the pretrained model. We evaluated our model
on three public benchmarks GYAFC, Amazon,
and Yelp and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the overall metrics


# 1 Introduction
Text style transfer is the task of converting a sentence from one style to another while preserving
style-agnostic semantics. In solving the text style
transfer task, three criteria must be considered: 1)
style control, how well a style is transferred from
the original sentence to the generated one, 2) content preservation, how well the generated sentence
has retained the semantics of the original, and 3)
fluency, how natural the generated sentence is.
Text style transfer is challenging, since fluently
converting the style of a sentence often conflicts
with content preservation (Prabhumoye et al., 2018;
John et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019). To address
this challenge, several supervised text style transfer methods have been attempted (Jhamtani et al.,
2017; Al Nahas et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2021b).
But style-labeled sentence pairs are often not available, making that approach less practical in a realworld setting. Various unsupervised text style
