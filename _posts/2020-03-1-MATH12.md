# Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: One-Sample Tests
즉, 가설검증이다.     
test라는 위딩이 들어갔다는 것은 이 추정의 결과로 인한 **의사결정**까지 한다는 것이다.     

One-Sample Tests: 데이터 세트가 하나이다.      
* One-Sample Tests: 우리나라 사람의 아이큐가 100 이상이다 -> 우리나라 사람의 아이큐라는 하나의 데이터 세트가 필요하다     
* Two-Sample Tests: 우리나라와 일본의 아이큐를 비교해보면 우리나라가 더 높다 -> 우리나라 아이쿠 데이터 세트와 일본의 아이큐 데이터세트가 필요하다. 즉, 비교, 변화 검증에 많이 쓰인다.

# Example: Upper-Tail t Test for Mean (𝜎)
그럼 이제 위의 개념을 이용해 문제를 풀어보며 이해를 해보자!    
그럼 무슨 개념인지 더 와닿을 것이다.   

## PROBLEM
A phone industry manager thinks that customer monthly cell phone bills have increased, and **now average over $52 per month**. The company wishes to test this claim. (Assume a normal population)

➡️  **now average over $52 per month**: 52보다는 많다 이므로 one-tail 이라는 것을 알 수 있다.     

**[Form hypothesis test:]**   
* $$H_0 : μ$$ **$$<=$$** $$52$$   
 * the mean is not over $52 per month        
* $$H_1 : μ > 52$$    
 * the mean is greater than $52 per month   


## SOLVE
**1) Find Rejection Region**      
* Suppose that a = 0.10 is chosen for this test and n = 25.    
* Find the rejection region:

**2) Test Statistic**    
Obtain sample and compute the test statistic   
Suppose a sample is taken with the following results:      
* n = 25, = 53.1, and S = 10
* Then the test statistic is

**3. (T/F) The director of the city Park and Recreation Department claims that the mean distance people travel to the city's greenbelt is 5.0 miles. Assume that the population standard deviation is known to be 1.2 miles and the significance level to be used to test the hypothesis is 0.01 when a sample size of n = 64 people are surveyed. Given this information, if the sample mean is 5.9 miles, the null hypothesis should be rejected.**

일단 맞는지 아닌지 보는 것 이므로 two-tail test가 맞다.     
* mean 5.0 miles

A sample of 30 days reveals a daily average revenue of $625. If you were to test the null hypothesis that the daily average revenue was $675 and decide not to reject the null hypothesis, what can you conclude?**       
a) There is not enough evidence to conclude that the daily average revenue was $675.

**[TABLE 9]**       
A student claims that he can correctly identify whether a person is a business major or an agriculture major by the way the person dresses. Suppose in actuality that if someone is a business major, he can correctly identify that person as a business major 87% of the time. When a person is an agriculture major, the student will incorrectly identify that person as a business major 16% of the time. Presented with one person and asked to identify the major of this person (who is either a business or agriculture major), he considers this to be a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis being that the person is a business major and the alternative that the person is an agriculture major.      


**6. Referring to Table 9, what would be a Type I error?**      
a) Saying that the person is a business major when in fact the person is a business major.     
b) Saying that the person is a business major when in fact the person is an agriculture major.   
c) Saying that the person is an agriculture major when in fact the person is a business major.   
d) Saying that the person is an agriculture major when in fact the person is an agriculture major.
