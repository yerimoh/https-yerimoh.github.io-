 Increase in the use of Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) has facilitated advances in predictive healthcare. However, EHR systems lack
a unified code system for representing medical concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR
present a barrier for the training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models
at scale. To overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb,
a code-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for predictive modeling
on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of neural language models while maintaining a neutral approach that can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific
representation learning or predictive modeling.
We test our modelâ€™s capacity on various experiments including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb shows higher
performance in overall experiments compared
to the code-based approach, opening the door
to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare research that is not constrained by EHR
structure nor special domain knowledge.
