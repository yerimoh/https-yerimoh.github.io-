Recent success of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) has stimulated interest in their ability
to understand and work with numbers. Yet, the
numerical reasoning over measurements has
not been formally studied despite their importance. In this study, we show that PLMs lack
the capability required for reasoning over measurements. Furthermore, we find that a language model trained on a measurement-rich
corpus shows better performance on understanding measurements. We propose a simple embedding strategy to better distinguish
between numbers and units, which leads to a
significant improvement in the probing tasks.



To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first
to investigate reasoning over measurements. Our
analysis shows that PLMs lack the capability required for reasoning over measurements. We proposed a scale embedding approach that provides in-
formation on the position and scale of numbers, and
it significantly increases the MST performance.
